Custom Recipes
=============

Welcome to the official repository of Custom Recipes by TheBoo! Here you'll find the source code behind the mod, as well as an issue tracker and some test builds!

#### **Creating an Issue**
Have a suggestion? Does the mod crash? Did you find a bug? Those are some of many resons for creating an issue!

1. Check if your issue already exists, or if someone else reported a similar issue.
2. Go to the issues page.
3. Click the `New Issue` button at the top.
4. Enter your Issue's title (something that summarizes your issue), and then create a detailed description about the issue as well as steps to re-create it if it's a bug.
5. (Optional) Assign the issue to TheBoo. *I will notice it quicker if you do so.* *This is not possible if you are not a contributor.*
6. Choose the kind of the issue. *This is not possible if you are not a contributor.*
7. Choose the priority (if it's a critical bug or crash, pick a high priority. If it's a minor bug, pick a low priority). *This is not possible if you are not a contributor.*
8. Attach a screenshot, it'd help alot.
9. Click the `Create New Issue` button at the bottom.
